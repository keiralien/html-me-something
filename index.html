					<h2>The Early Times</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>What can I say about the early days? My babyhood was pretty standard. Mom was always there, watching over me and my fellow potatoes, Bertie and Bob. I spent a lot of time sleeping, eating and chewing on Bob. He had a very springy tail and  whimper that drove me bonkers. Bertie was chill.</p>

					<h2>Separation</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>My mother's human separated us when I was eight weeks old. I was put in a cage and shipped off for what I can only assume was experimentation. They put some kind of device in me, and poked me with extremely sharp hollow teeth. You don't want to know some of the other things they did. The indignities I've suffered! Luckily, they tired of the experimentation fairly soon and I found my way into a large cage place filled with potatoes of all shapes, sizes and colors.</p>

					<h2>Kidnapped by Weirdos</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>I lived in a cage with a glass front and other potatoes for only a couple of days. Many humans came to play with the potatoes. Some of them were tiny with poking little fingers that left smudges on the glass. Those weren't so nice. It wasn't long before a pair of weirdos kidnapped me. The cage keepers just let these complete strangers take me with them into the cold and snowy night. I really ought to lodge a complaint with management. That seems incredibly irresponsible.</p>

					<h2>Day to Day</h2>
				</header>
			
				<p>Life with my captors soon fell into a routine. They tried to feed me the same food as the potato place, which was utterly unnacceptable. That food was terrible! They got the hint soon enough and provided food of a softer variety, which was far preferable. They still kept me in a cage some of the time, at night, when they were out, etc. They made sure I had toys for amusement and water in my oversized hamster dispenser. It could be worse.</p>

					<h3>Potty Training</h3>
				</header>
				
				<p>For some reason, humans are obsessed with potty training. It's really unnecessary since I'm a clean potato! It's okay, though. They put up a bell for me to ring to go outside. It only took a day or two for me to begin using it. Now I can go out and play whenever I want! Sometimes it seems to irritate the humans when I ring it every five minutes. I wouldn't us it if it didn't work, though.</p>

					<h3>Forced March</h3>
				</header>
				
				<p>The forced march. Every day. Why? What's so special about putting one foot in front of the other? I've got four. It's really not that great! They force me to wear the harness, aka The Ultimate Symbol of Shame, and insist on putting one foot in front of the other. I can't even stop and smell appropriately because they're just so impatient! Who doesn't want to spend 3-5 minutes sniffing that bush, or that signpost or that mailbox every 10 feet. Is that really so much to ask? At least when I was smaller they'd carry me when I plopped down. Now they just make me walk. The nerve!</p>

					<h3>Fellow Inmates</h3>
				</header>
				
				<p>I soon realized I wasn't the only potato the humans had kidnapped. There were three others, and to my dismay, they'd already formed a clique. I tried my best to get the other potatoes to play with me, but it's an uphill battle. To date, only the youngest (the humans call her "Peaches", "Butt", and a variety of other pet names) has really shown interest. She no longer tries to swipe at me when I sniff her. She'll even rub against me in what I can only assume is a strange friendship dance. She still doesn't play all that well, and I think there's something wrong with her voice 'cause I've never heard her bark. Still, progress is progress!</p>
