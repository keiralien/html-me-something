				<h2>The Early Times</h2>
			</header>
			
			<p>What can I say about the early days? My babyhood was pretty standard. Mom was always there, watching over me and my fellow potatoes, Bertie and Bob. I spent a lot of time sleeping, eating and chewing on Bob. He had a very springy tail and  whimper that drove me bonkers. Bertie was chill.</p>

				<h2>Separation</h2>
			</header>
			
			<p>My mother's human separated us when I was eight weeks old. I was put in a cage and shipped off for what I can only assume was experimentation. They put some kind of device in me, and poked me with extremely sharp hollow teeth. You don't want to know some of the other things they did. The indignities I've suffered! Luckily, they tired of the experimentation fairly soon and I found my way into a large cage place filled with potatoes of all shapes, sizes and colors.</p>

				<h2>Kidnapped by Weirdos</h2>
			</header>
			
			<p>I lived in the cages with the other potatoes all around for only a couple of days. Many humans came to play with the potatoes - some even played with me. It wasn't long before a pair of weirdos kidnapped me. The cage keepers just let these complete strangers take me with them into the cold and snowy night. I really ought to lodge a complaint with management. They seem incredibly irresponsible.</p>

				<h2>Day to Day</h2>
			</header>
		
			<p>Life with my captors soon fell into a routine. They tried to feed me the same food as the cage place, which was utterly unnacceptable. That food was terrible! They got the hint soon enough and provided food of a softer variety, which was far preferable. They still kept me in a cage some of the time, at night, when they were out, etc. They made sure I had toys for amusement and water in my oversized hamster dispenser.</p>

				<h3>Forced March</h3>
			</header>
			
			<p>The forced march. Every day. Why? What's so special about putting one foot in front of the other? I've got four. It's really not special! They force me to wear the harness, aka The Ultimate Symbol of Shame, and insist on putting one foot in front of the other. I can't even stop and smell appropriately because they're just so impatient! Who doesn't want to spend 3-5 minutes sniffing that bush, or that signpost or that mailbox every 10 feet. Is that really so much to ask? At least when I was smaller they'd carry me when I plopped down. Now they just make me walk. The nerve!</p>
